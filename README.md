# Stock-Market-Predictor

This Project came into existence when a Undergraduate student found their interest in the share market and thought of doing the obvious and fuse it with machine learning. The trade market provided us with the perfect opportunity to regressively test our techniques all while learning something new.

The share taken into consideration was Reliance this because of the sheer market cap it has in India hence this study could somewhat be extrapolated to the large-cap index of Nifty too and is a clear view of how large companies in India have managed to strengthen their footings along the years.

The problem statement we seek to dwell upon in this project revolves around two major factors:-

To see how different ML models wrap-around stock prices and find out which suits it the most both in regression and classification

Then analyze the share for India's largest conglomerate “Reliance Industries” and see how far we can stretch the model by only using data from the years 2017-2019.

This involves :
i. Predicting the stock price to a certain extent(regression)
ii. Give trading calls till some extent(classification)
To ensure the utmost reliability of the experiment the time of the dataset was taken to be 2017-2018 this was done so that the unusual market that was seen during the times of covid can be avoided and hence the major outlying consistency could be avoided.
